Set a post format or post type for your IFTTT-created posts via a post format or post type category.

== Description ==

IFTTT (if this, then that) is one of the coolest web services available, and allows you to connect your different web service accounts to create 'recipes'. An example of a recipe that I have is to create a new WordPress post on my blog whenever I favorite a YouTube video.

Unfortunately IFTTT doesn't have a way to specify a post format or a custom post type, so this plugin provides a couple ways to update them.

To set the post format, you need to set the category in IFTTT to one of the following categories:

* `ifttt-aside`
* `ifttt-gallery`
* `ifttt-link`
* `ifttt-image`
* `ifttt-quote`
* `ifttt-status`
* `ifttt-video`
* `ifttt-audio`
* `ifttt-chat`

So for my YouTube -> WordPress recipe, I have it adding the 'ifttt-video' category, and voil√†, when it's published, the format has been set.

If you want to instead set the new post to a custom post type, you can do so by setting the category in IFTTT to one that matches this pattern: **`ifttt-posttype-{post_type_slug}`**. So if you wanted to create new WordPress pages with IFTTT, you would add the **`ifttt-posttype-page`** category.

Hope you find this useful.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set the post type with this plugin? =
* This was added in version [0.1.1](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ifttt-post-formats/changelog/). To set the new post to a custom post type, you can do so by setting the category in IFTTT to one that matches this pattern: **`ifttt-posttype-{post_type_slug}`**. So if you wanted to create new WordPress pages with IFTTT, you would add the **`ifttt-posttype-page`** category.

= How can I change the taxonomy for the IFTTT categories? =
* This ability was added in version [0.1.2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ifttt-post-formats/changelog/). You can hook into the `ifttt_pfpt_taxonomy_to_save_as` filter like so:
`function ifttt_pfpt_save_as_custom_taxonomy( $taxonomy ) {
	$taxonomy = 'custom-taxonomy-slug';
	return $taxonomy;
}
add_filter( 'ifttt_pfpt_taxonomy_to_save_as', 'ifttt_pfpt_save_as_custom_taxonomy' );`

Set a post format for your IFTTT-created posts via a post format category.

== Description ==

IFTTT (if this, then that) is one of the coolest web services available, and allows you to connect your different web service accounts to create 'recipes'. An example of a recipe that I have is to create a new WordPress post on my blog whenever I favorite a YouTube video.

Unfortunately IFTTT doesn't have a way to specify a post format, so this allows you to have the post format added by using a specific category. Just add a category with 'ifttt-' + your post format, and when the post is created, it will set the post format and remove the faux category.

So for my YouTube->WordPress recipe, I have it adding the 'ifttt-video' category, and voil√†, when it's published, the format has been set.

Hope you find this useful.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ifttt-post-formats` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
